# Technical test - Backend

The main goal of this test is to estimate your technical knowledge on Laravel framework and SQL language.

## Prerequisites

- PHP `^8.0.2`
- Laratest project
- A running MySQL database and - **[./laratest.sql](./laratest.sql)** script executed
  - Charset `utf8mb4`
  - Collation `utf8mb4_general_ci`

## Exercice

- Create a `CustomerResource` for the API, exposing properly customers and their stores.
- Add a `has_optin` field (boolean). This optin is the customer's approval for receiving commercial messages.
- Add a `PATCH` endpoint to update this field, and create associated test
- Add a soft delete on table customers
- Create a command allowing us via `php artisan` to delete customers inactive since at least 6 months, and anonymize the customers' data for those deleted since at least a month. You must use Laravel `Job` to lighten server load.
- Create a raw SQL request to obtain, by customer on his associated store, the number of visits, the dates of first and last visit. You can commit it in a `./requests.sql` file.
- BONUS: Now, expose the same data on a `GET` endpoint `/customers/visits`
